# Vacuum Tubes Notes
- Standard tube outline (circle) 400 mils anchored at 0,0.
- Always show index pin.
- DeMorgan Standard: should be in pin order.
- DeMorgan Alternate: should be grouped by workflow. * see Image 1, below.
- Should show internal wiring of pin to element.
- For internal visual layout try to reference a manufacturer data sheet.
- Unused pins may be hidden. But I have found some real world circuits that use these as extra connection locations.

Symbol properties

- Reference value: V?
- Value: Tube identifier, such as "12SA7" or leave blank
- Description: Most common usage, such as "OSCILLATOR/MIXER" or leave blank
- Symbol name: same as value
- Keywords: common name for tube, such as "PENTAGRID CONVERTER, HEPTODE", could also
  contain other tube identifiers
