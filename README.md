# Vintage-Radio-KiCad-Symbols
Vacuum tube and passive components most commonly found in pre-transistor radios.

Primary goal is to create a set of symbol libraries that cover 99% of the components 
found in older tube radios such as the All American Fives (AA5) and others. The libraries 
should contain common items, even if already present in other standard libraries. Reduce 
the choices to create effeciency.

## This is a work in progress
No guarantees are made for usability. These symbols were drawn in KiCad 8.0 and later.

## Design notes
- All symbols should be drawn on 50.00 mils grid (Kicad default for all symbols).
- All pins/connections must fall on this grid.

## See individual library README's for more information specific to that library.
